# bubble-sort

Manually created sort function for Ruby array, utilizes bubble sort method to parse through array integers and return a sorted array.

Evaluates array in pairs, and swaps pair as needed to ensure the lesser value is first, and the greater value is second.

Cycles through array repeatedly performing this task until no more array values are out of place, and the array is sorted correctly.
